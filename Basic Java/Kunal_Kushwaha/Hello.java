// This is the first program of the java programing language.

public class Hello{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("Hello "); // print new line

                    -------Some basic information --------
--> In java we put the collon (;) it basically means the line is over here:

--> The name of your java class must same as java file name  otherwise java program will give an Error .

--> Every file which ends with (.java) that is class itself.ex - Hello.java --> This is a class itself.

--> class is just name group of  properties and functions which is used to creating objects.

--> The first letter of class name should be capital letter. ex - public class Hello --> Here in Hello (H) is capital. If the name of class starts with small letter it will be work but it's not good practice.

--> In java name of function starts with small letter.ex - public static void main(String args[]) -- main is a function name.

--> public means this class can be access from anywhere.
--> When i share this java class file any of you.You all will be able to run this file because java is a platform indipendent.

--> javac is a java compiler that translate human readable java code into the machine code (byte code).

--> System is a class in java and out is a static variable of the system class.
--> In java everything which starts with capital letter that is a class itself. ex- System.
